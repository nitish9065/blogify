Definitions

Post
A blog post is a piece of written content that includes a title, body text, optional images, tags, and publication date. Posts can be drafts or published articles.

Category
A category is a broad classification used to organize blog posts into main themes or topics (e.g., "Technology", "Travel", "Personal Development").

Tag
A tag is a specific keyword or phrase that describes the content of a post in more detail than categories. Unlike categories which are broad groupings, tags are more granular and flexible (e.g., "Python", "Machine Learning", "Book Review", "Venice"). A single post can have multiple tags to improve searchability and content discovery.
